## 3. Running the code

* ### Deep n-step Advantage Actor-Critic Agent:

    The [a2c_agent.py](./a2c_agent.py) is the main script that takes care of the training and testing of the deep n-step advantage Actor-Critic agent.
    The table below summarizes the argument that the script supports and what they mean. Note that, most of the agent and environment
    related configuration parameters are in the [a2c_parameters.json](./a2c_parameters.json) file and only those few parameters that are more useful
    when launching the training/testing scripts are made available through the command line interface.

    | Argument      | Description |
    |---------------| ------------------------ |
    |`--env`        | Name of the OpenAI Gym interface compatible environment. Use `Carla-v0` if you want to train/test in the Carla driving environment. Supports other Gym environments as well|
    |`--params-file`| Path to the json parameters file. Default=`./a2c_parameters.json`|   
    |`--model-dir`  | Directory to save/load trained agent brain/model. Default=`./trained_models`|
    |`--render`     | True/False to render/not-render the environment to the display|
    |`--test`       | Run the agent in test mode using a saved trained brain/model. Learning is disabled|
    |`--gpu-id`     | GPU device ID to use. Default=0|
    
    #### A2C Training
    Make sure the `rl_gym_book` conda environment with the necessary packages installed is activated. Assuming that you cloned 
    the code as per the instructions to `~/HOIAWOG/`,  you can launch the Agent training script from the `~/HOIAWOG/ch8` directory using the following command:
    
    `python a2c_agent.py --env Carla-v0 --gpu-id 0` 
    
    If a saved agent "brain" (trained model) is available for the chosen environment, the training script will upload 
    that brain to the agent and continue training the agent to improve further.
    
    The log files are written to the directory pointed with the `summary_file_path_prefix` parameter (the default is `logs/A2C_`). When the training script is running, you can monitor the learning progress of the agent visually using Tensorboard. From the `~/HOIAWOG/ch6` directory, you can launch Tensorboard with the following command: `tensorboard --log_dir=./logs/`. 
    You can then visit the web URL printed on the console (the default one is: http://localhost:6006) to monitor the progress.
    
    You can train the agent in *any* Gym compatible environment by providing the Gym env ID for the `--env` argument.
    Listed below are some short list of environments that you can train the agent in:
    
    |Environment Types                                                   | Example command to train                                  |
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------| ----------------------------------------------------------|
    | [Gym classic control](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#classic_control)| `python a2c_agent.py --env Acrobot-v1 --gpu-id 0`        |
    | [Gym Box2D](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#box2d)                    |`python a2c_agent.py --env LunarLander-v2 --gpu-id 0`    |
    | [Gym Atari environment](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#atari)        | `python a2c_agent.py --env AlienNoFrameskip-v4 --gpu-id 0`|
    | [Roboschool](https://github.com/openai/roboschool)                 | `python a2c_agent.py --env RoboschoolHopper-v1 --gpu-id 1`| 
    
    #### A2C Testing
    Make sure the `rl_gym_book` conda environment with the necessary packages installed is activated. Assuming that you cloned 
    the code as per the instructions to `~/HOIAWOG/`,  you can launch the Agent testing script from the `~/HOIAWOG/ch8` directory using the following command:
    
    `python a2c_agent.py --env Carla-v0 --test --render`
    
    The above command will launch the agent in testing mode by uploading the saved brain state (if available) for this environment
    to the agent. The `--test` argument disables learning and simply evaluates the agent's performance in the chosen environment.
    
    You can test the agent in any OpenAI Gym interface compatible learning environment like with the training procedure.
    Listed below are some example environments from the list of environments for which trained brains/models are made available
    in this repository:
    
    |Environment Types                                                   | Example command to train                                  |
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------| ----------------------------------------------------------|
    | [Gym classic control](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#classic_control)| `python a2c_agent.py --env Pendulum-v0 --test --render`        |
    | [Gym Box2D](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#box2d)                    |`python a2c_agent.py --env BipedalWalker-v2 --test --render`    |
    | [Gym Atari environment](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#atari)        | `python a2c_agent.py --env RiverraidNoFrameskip-v4 --test --render --gpu-id 0`|
    | [Roboschool](https://github.com/openai/roboschool)                 | `python a2c_agent.py --env RoboschoolHopper-v1 --test --render --gpu-id 1`| 
    

* ### Asynchronous Deep n-step Advantage Actor-Critic Agent:

    The [async_a2c_agent.py](./async_a2c_agent.py) is the main script that takes care of the training and testing of the asynchronous deep n-step advantage Actor-Critic agent.
    The table below summarizes the argument that the script supports and what they mean. Note that, most of the agent and environment
    related configuration parameters are in the [async_a2c_parameters.json](./async_a2c_parameters.json) file and only those few parameters that are more useful
    when launching the training/testing scripts are made available through the command line interface.
    
    | Argument      | Description |
    |---------------| ------------------------ |
    |`--env`        | Name of the Gym-compatible environment. Use `Carla-v0` if you want to train/test in the Carla driving environment. Supports other Gym environments as well|
    |`--params-file`| Path to the json parameters file. Default=`./async_a2c_parameters.json`|   
    |`--model-dir`  | Directory to save/load trained agent brain/model. Default=`./trained_models`|
    |`--render`     | True/False to render/not-render the environment to the display|
    |`--test`       | Run the agent in test mode using a saved trained brain/model. Learning is disabled|
    |`--gpu-id`     | GPU device ID to use. Default=0|

    #### Async A2C Training
    
    **NOTE:** Because this agent training script will spawn multiple agents and environment instances, make sure
    you set the `num_agents` parameter in [async_a2c_parameters.json](./async_a2c_parameters.json) file to sensible values based
    on the hardware of the machine on which you are running this script. If you are using the `Carla-v0` environment to
    train the agent in the Carla driving environment, be aware that the Carla server instance itself needs some GPU resource to run 
    on top of the agent's resource needs.
    
    Make sure the `rl_gym_book` conda environment with the necessary packages installed is activated. Assuming that you cloned 
    the code as per the instructions to `~/HOIAWOG/`,  you can launch the Agent training script from the `~/HOIAWOG/ch8` directory using the following command:
    
    `python async_a2c_agent.py --env Carla-v0 --gpu-id 0` 
    
    If a saved agent "brain" (trained model) is available for the chosen environment, the training script will upload 
    that brain to the agent and continue training the agent to improve further.

    The above command will launch the agent in testing mode by uploading the saved brain state (if available) for this environment
